# venster.io
An NFT viewer for on-chain and generative art on the Cardano blockchain.

## for on-chain art

Cardano's unique take on NFTs with native tokens makes it the perfect environment for on-chain art, but it lacks the viewers to really take advantage of the technology.

The Venster Metadata Standard for on-chain NFTs is focussed on simplicity, efficiency and reproducibility.

## for generative art

Generative art and blockchain technology are a perfect marriage. But sometimes it may not be feasible to store all dependencies for a generative artwork on the blockchain.

Venster supports p5.js, among other common tools, but also server-side languages and custom implementations.

## by artists, for artists
It takes an artist to know what artists need or want. Having built our own infrastructure to release DendroRithms, we experienced first-hand what Cardano is missing.

With Venster, we're scratching our own itch. We're building the the perfect viewer for on-chain and generative art.
